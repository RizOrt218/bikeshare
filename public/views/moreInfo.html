    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Bikeshare Hawaii is a not-for-profit 501(c)3 organization aiming to launch and manage bikeshare in the state of Hawaii. It strives to create a strong public/private partnership in order to launch and maintain bikeshare systems throughout the state. It will seek public and private funding to launch operations and is designed to maintain and grow system coverage through revenue generated by its customers. Bikeshare Hawaii is currently supported by Ulupono Initiative, Hawaii Pacific University, the State of Hawaii and the City and County of Honolulu, and is actively seeking other partnerships.  Governor Neil Abercrombie and Mayor Kirk Caldwell were both early advocates of bikeshare in Hawaii and provided key start-up funding commitments.</p>
